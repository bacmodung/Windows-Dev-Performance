# Windows Developers' Issues

## Welcome to the Windows Developer (WinDev) Issues repo!

The purpose of this repo is to collect and catalog issues that affect / impact developers who work on Windows. It doesn't matter if you're developing applications FOR Windows or applications that you plan to deploy on Linux, Android, IoT devices, servers, containers, or cloud - if you're building code ON Windows, we'd love to hear from you.

This repo is being driven and managed by a x-team, x-division group of PMs and engineers who're all passionate about improving developers' experience on Windows. We are already coordinating several streams of ongoing work with teams across the company and throughout the community, aiming to drive many issues to ground.

## Scope of this repo
Please take note of the current scope of this repo:

We are currently only accepting specific types of issues at this time, while we build our skills and processes to triage and handle incoming issues.

> In the future, we plan to broaden our scope to accept other types of issues, but for now, please only submit in-scope issues to this repo.

### ✔ In Scope

At present we are accepting __developer-oriented performance issues__. Such issues include, for example:
* Dev tools (e.g. compilers, linkers, etc.) running slower on Windows than expected
* Runtime platforms (e.g. node, .NET, Python) running slower on Windows than other platforms
* Your apps experiencing file IO/networking/process-creation related perf issues
* Etc.
